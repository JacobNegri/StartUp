<h2>About Us</h2>

<p>
    Synergy is an application that university students download, it is attached to Learn.Jcu
    and allows students to have everything they need in one easy to access location.
    The application allows for seamless communication on projects and allows the students to all communicate in a messenger
    page. Lecturers are able to upload task sheets any any form of communication they want with their students easily.
    This application removes the need for all university students to have to have multiple different platforms on their phones and
    for chats to be forgotten about, this removes the need for slack, messenger, discord along with google docs as the application
    has a built in word program so that student can work on documents together in one location.
